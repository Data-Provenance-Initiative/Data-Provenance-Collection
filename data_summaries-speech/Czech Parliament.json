            "PwC Description": "We present a large corpus of Czech parliament plenary sessions. The corpus consists of approximately 1200 hours of speech data and corresponding text transcriptions. The whole corpus has been segmented to short audio segments making it suitable for both training and evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The source language of the corpus is Czech, which makes it a valuable resource for future research as only a few public datasets are available in the Czech language. We complement the data release with experiments of two baseline ASR systems trained on the presented data: the more traditional approach implemented in the Kaldi ASRtoolkit which combines hidden Markov models and deep neural networks (NN) and a modern ASR architecture implemented in Jaspertoolkit which uses deep NNs in an end-to-end fashion.",
