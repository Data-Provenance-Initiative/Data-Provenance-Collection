The dataset is composed of 6,766 video clips from 51 action categories (such as “jump”, “kiss” and “laugh”), with each category containing at least 101 clips. The original evaluation scheme uses three different training/testing splits. In each split, each action class has 70 clips for training and 30 clips for testing. The average accuracy over these three splits is used to measure the final performance.",
