The animated GIFs have been collected from Tumblr, from randomly selected posts published between May and June of 2015. The dataset provides the URLs of animated GIFs. The sentences are collected via crowdsourcing, with a carefully designed annotation interface that ensures high quality dataset. There is one sentence per animated GIF for the training and validation splits, and three sentences per GIF for the test split. The dataset can be used to evaluate animated GIF/video description techniques.",
