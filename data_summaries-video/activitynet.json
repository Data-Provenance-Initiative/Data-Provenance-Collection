            "PwC Description": "The ActivityNet dataset contains 200 different types of activities and a total of 849 hours of videos collected from YouTube. ActivityNet is the largest benchmark for temporal activity detection to date in terms of both the number of activity categories and number of videos, making the task particularly challenging. Version 1.3 of the dataset contains 19994 untrimmed videos in total and is divided into three disjoint subsets, training, validation, and testing by a ratio of 2:1:1. On average, each activity category has 137 untrimmed videos. Each video on average has 1.41 activities which are annotated with temporal boundaries. The ground-truth annotations of test videos are not public.",
