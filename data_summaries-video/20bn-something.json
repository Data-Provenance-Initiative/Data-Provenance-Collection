The dataset was created by a large number of crowd workers. It allows machine learning models to develop fine-grained understanding of basic actions that occur in the physical world. It contains 220,847 videos, with 168,913 in the training set, 24,777 in the validation set and 27,157 in the test set. There are 174 labels.\n\nSource\n\nImage Source",
