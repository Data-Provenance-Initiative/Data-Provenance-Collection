The different legal bases we rely on are: Performance of a contract - we must process your personal data in order to be able to provide you with one of our products, activities or services Consent - you have told us you are happy for us to process your personal data for a specific purpose(s) Legitimate interests - our processing is necessary for us to conduct our business, but not where our interests are overridden by your interests or rights Public interest - our processing is necessary for us to meet our Royal Charter duty for serving the public interest Legal obligation - we are required to process your personal information by law Whenever we process your data by Consent, we keep a record of the consent you provided. Whenever we process your data under Legitimate Interests, we complete a legitimate interest assessment form and carry out a balancing test to safeguard privacy rights. ## How do we use your personal information? ## We may use your information for the following purposes: ### To provide our products, activities, and services ### We need to use your personal information to make our products, activities, and services available to you. When you order, subscribe, or submit a request, we will process any personal information you share in order to meet your expectations and our commitment to you as a customer. ### For marketing ### We use your personal data to provide you with information and news about our products, activities, and services by email, phone, post, and online advertising. As part of this, online advertising may be displayed on RSC websites and on other organisations\u2019 websites and online media channels. ### To contact you ### We use your personal information to contact you. This may be in relation to an issue you have raised with us, a service update, market research or to ask for your feedback. ### For safety and security ### We use personal information to help provide safe and secure environments for our business to be conducted in and for our staff to work in. To enable this, we use CCTV inside and within the grounds of RSC premises. ### Analytics and profiling ### We use your personal information for statistical analysis and to help us understand more about our customers. This helps us to serve you better, to find ways to improve our products, activities and services, and to make them more relevant to you. ## Who might we share your personal information with? ## We will share your personal information in certain circumstances with service providers or other individuals so that we can provide you with applicable products, activities, and services and ensure we provide a high-quality and personalised service. ### Our service providers ### We work with different companies so that they can help us provide and maintain the products, activities, and services you require from us, or that we think you might be interested in. These include: Software system vendors \u2013 including those used to manage customer data, regulate workflows, host websites, deliver targeted marketing, and process purchases Cloud storage providers \u2013 for secure storage of data controlled by the RSC Banks, finance management, direct debit, and accountancy system providers \u2013 so that we can process payments with you in accordance with the appropriate transaction that you are entering into with us Article production and administration suppliers \u2013 to process books and accepted journal articles through copy-editing, typesetting, and proof correction for publication Printing, mailing, and delivery companies \u2013 for fulfilment of external printing and to send you written communications and hard copies of newsletters and magazines Funders, universities, and research organisations \u2013 providing specific information about the authors of our journal articles and other publishing products Abstracting & Indexing services such as Crossref, PubMed, and Scopus, as well as subscribers and purchasers of our journals \u2013 so that we can maximise the visibility of published work Telemarketing agencies \u2013 who help us with our membership renewal process Electoral service providers \u2013 who assist us with the running of our elections process Legal, wellbeing, counselling, mentoring, and career services \u2013 to provide you with the service you might choose to subscribe to Social media providers \u2013 where you have submitted a community-related news story to us and we have published it Travel companies, taxi services, and flight providers \u2013 where you ask us to make such arrangements on your behalf Venues - where we are running an event and the venue requires personal details of attendees to make bookings, for example, hotel rooms Books sales agents, distributors, shipping agents \u2013 in order to fulfil our sales obligations to you Advertising companies - who help us place RSC adverts online and on other media Logistics and delivery providers - who enable us to deliver products ordered from us Market research partners - who help us process customer feedback ### Our contributors and advisors ### We work with individuals who support our work either voluntarily or through a contractual arrangement. These include: Peer reviewers, editorial board members, and guest editors \u2013 who help us preserve the quality and integrity of our chemical science literature Reviewers and judges \u2013 in relation to an application for an award, scholarship, bursary, grant funding, or participation in an event or competition Professional advisors, such as lawyers and consultants \u2013 but only for specific circumstances ### Other organisations and individuals ### We may share your personal information in certain scenarios. For example: If we're discussing selling an RSC-owned product (for example a journal), we may share information about you with prospective purchasers and their advisers - but only so they can evaluate the relevant business If we are required to by law or by a public or regulatory authority If we need to do so in order to enforce or protect our legal rights, property, users, systems, and services In response to requests from individuals (or their representatives) seeking to protect their rights or the rights of others. We will only share your personal information in response to requests which do not override your privacy interests ## Automated decision making ## The RSC does not use any automated means to make decisions about individuals. We will share email addresses, which have been given directly to RSC by data subjects, or browsing information, obtained in ways such as pixel tracking, to enable us to show tailored adverts on a third-party platform, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google, who may perform profiling. ## International transfers of personal information ## On occasions, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the UK. For example, this may happen where any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the UK. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK but, where possible, we seek to work with service providers whose servers are wholly located within the UK or, if that is not possible, within a country covered by UK adequacy regulations. If we transfer your information to a country not covered by UK adequacy regulations, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your privacy rights. These steps include contracting with providers on the basis of the UK\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA). Our drafting of IDTAs makes reference to Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and Transfer Risk Assessments (TRA) in all cases. We have not set out the specific circumstances for each international transfer. You can email us for the details of how we protect specific transfers of your data. ## Keeping you informed about our products, activities, and services ## We would like from time to time to tell you about the great RSC products, activities, and services that we think you might be interested in. Where we have explicit consent or when it is determined there is a mutual legitimate interest, we may do this by post, email, text message, phone, through online advertising, or by any other electronic means. We won't send you marketing messages if you tell us not to, but if you subscribe to a service from us, we will still need to send you service-related messages and may still send you surveys (you can always opt out of these via the survey email itself). All messages sent under Legitimate Interests contain appropriate safeguards to ensure we do not contact you again when you might not be not interested. This is normally an unsubscribe link. For communications processed under Consent, you can withdraw your consent using the unsubscribe link in a message or at any time by sending an email. Please note that it can take a little while for unsubscribe requests to be fully completed since some items may already be in transit. ## Your rights ## You have a number of rights under data protection legislation which, in certain circumstances, you may be able to exercise in relation to the personal information we process about you. These include: the right to access a copy of the personal information we hold about you the right to correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you the right to restrict our use of your personal information the right to be forgotten the right of data portability and the right to object to our use of your personal information Where we rely on consent as the legal basis on which we process your personal information, you may also withdraw that consent at any time. If you are seeking to exercise any of these rights, Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted by e-mail or in writing to Thomas Graham House, Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WF. Please note that we will need to verify your identity before we can fulfil any of your rights under data protection law. This helps us to protect your personal data against fraudulent requests. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office. ## How long will we keep your personal information for? ## We will keep your personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement and in accordance with the law and relevant regulations. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary. We maintain an Information Retention Schedule for all our processing activities. You can email us for details on how long we retain information for specific processing of your data. ## Security ## We take protecting your personal information seriously and are continuously developing our security systems and processes. Some of the controls we have in place are: We limit physical access to our premises and user access to our systems to only those that we believe are entitled to be there We use technology controls for our information systems, such as firewalls, user verification, strong data encryption, and separation of roles, systems, and data Systems are proactively monitored through a \u201cdetect and respond\u201d information security function We use industry \u201cgood practice\u201d standards to support the maintenance of robust information security We enforce a \u201cneed to know\u201d approach, for access to any data or systems We are certified under the Cyber Essentials scheme (certificate number: IASME-CE-043025), which is the UK Government-backed scheme helping organisations protect against a whole range of the most common cyberattacks. ## CCTV surveillance ## We use CCTV surveillance for our sites at Thomas Graham House in Cambridge and at Burlington House in London for the protection of our volunteers, staff, visitors, and business premises. This includes investigating accidents, incidents, criminal activities, and breaches of our policies. We store recordings for a period of 60 days, after which time they are automatically deleted. In the event of an incident, recordings may be downloaded by our staff and stored securely in the interests of preserving evidence for any potential investigation and/or claim(s). Occasionally we may share recordings with public or regulatory authorities or in response to requests from individuals seeking to protect their rights, the rights of others, or helping to prevent crime and nuisance. We will only share CCTV if we consider a request to be appropriate. We may retain recordings that are downloaded for these purposes for a period of up to six years to take into account the statutory limitation periods for any potential investigation(s) or claim(s). Once any potential investigation(s) or claim(s) has concluded, we delete the relevant recording. ## Sources of your personal data not supplied directly by you ## We try whenever possible to avoid processing your data when it is not supplied by you. The occasions when we do are detailed below. ### Commissioning ### We may source personal data via publicly facing websites, journal papers, peer recommendations, institution websites, and contracted third-party databases to collate recommended contact lists for potential authors, reviewers, and editors. ### Prizes, Awards, and Lectureships ### We accept the nomination of individuals who might be eligible for a prize, award, or journal lectureship. The individuals concerned will likely not be aware of their nomination (which will contain some personal data) ### Honorary Fellows ### RSC members can confidentially nominate any person they believe desirable to admit as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (HonFRSC). The review of such information is restricted to the Nominations Committee. The legal basis for processing these data is Legitimate Interests. ## Children's data ## Our products and services that require the processing of personal data are not intended for or directed at children and we do not knowingly collect children\u2019s data for these. The RSC is not a provider of \u201cinformation society services\u201d as referenced in Article 8 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (referred to by the UK\u2019s ICO as \u201conline services\u201d). At some of our events, we may take photographs and videos that include children to publicise their achievements (e.g. prize winners). We may also take photographs or videos showing children taking part in a scientific activity (e.g. carrying out an experiment). In all cases, images are only taken if consent is secured from whoever holds parental responsibility for the child either directly or through a school\u2019s own data protection processes. We take the safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously so, for these purposes, we recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child. On occasions, the RSC runs competitions for schoolchildren. In such cases, the RSC does not collect children\u2019s personal data. Any related procedures requiring personal data processing (for example, issuing of certificates) are carried out through a school\u2019s own data protection processes. ## Chemists\u2019 Community Fund ## Any personal information that you share with the Chemists\u2019 Community Fund will be kept confidential and for the sole use of the Chemists\u2019 Community Fund. It is not accessible to RSC staff working in other areas. ## Fundraising ## Your personal information may be reviewed by RSC staff to help us deliver our charitable activities and raise funds. The RSC is registered with the UK\u2019s Fundraising Regulator. ## Cookies ## We use cookies to help give you the best experience on our websites and to allow us and third parties to tailor ads you see on our and other websites. For more information, please see our full Cookie Policy. ## Changes to this Statement ## This privacy statement was most recently updated in July 2022. If we make changes to it, then we will attempt to bring those changes to your attention. ### Help & legal ### Help Legal Terms of use Privacy statement Cookies and your privacy Accessibility Copyright & permissions Terms and Conditions of Purchase Modern Slavery Act statement Human Rights Policy ### Corporate website ### For queries regarding the functionality of https://www.rsc.org.

Retention duration of activity data depends on the site\u2019s plan and activity type. See the complete list of currently-recorded activities (along with retention information). Data Synced (?): Successful and failed login attempts, which will include the actor\u2019s IP address and user agent. Carousel Image views are only recorded if the site owner, has explicitly enabled image view stats tracking for this feature via the jetpack_enable_carousel_stats filter. Data Used: If image view tracking is enabled, the following information is used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Activity Tracked: Image views. Gravatar Hovercards Data Used: This feature will send a hash of the user\u2019s email address (if logged in to the site or WordPress.com \u2014 or if they submitted a comment on the site using their email address that is attached to an active Gravatar profile) to the Gravatar service (also owned by Automattic) in order to retrieve their profile image. Infinite Scroll Data Used: In order to record page views via WordPress.com Stats (which must be enabled for page view tracking here to work) with additional loads, the following information is used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Activity Tracked: Page views will be tracked with each additional load (i.e. when you scroll down to the bottom of the page and a new set of posts loads automatically). If the site owner has enabled Google Analytics to work with this feature, a page view event will also be sent to the appropriate Google Analytics account with each additional load. Likes This feature is only accessible to users logged in to WordPress.com. Data Used: In order to process a post like action, the following information is used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (on which the post was liked), post ID (of the post that was liked), user agent, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Activity Tracked: Post likes. Mobile Theme Data Used: A visitor\u2019s preference on viewing the mobile version of a site.

Protect Data Used: In order to check login activity and potentially block fraudulent attempts, the following information is used: attempting user\u2019s IP address, attempting user\u2019s email address/username (i.e. according to the value they were attempting to use during the login process), and all IP-related HTTP headers attached to the attempting user. Activity Tracked: Failed login attempts (these include IP address and user agent). We also set a cookie (jpp_math_pass) for 1 day to remember if/when a user has successfully completed a math captcha to prove that they\u2019re a real human. Learn more about this cookie. Data Synced (?): Failed login attempts, which contain the user\u2019s IP address, attempted username or email address, and user agent information. Sharing Data Used: When sharing content via email (this option is only available if Akismet is active on the site), the following information is used: sharing party\u2019s name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content. This content will be sent to Akismet (also owned by Automattic) so that a spam check can be performed. Additionally, if reCAPTCHA (by Google) is enabled by the site owner, the sharing party\u2019s IP address will be shared with that service. You can find Google\u2019s privacy policy here. Simple Payments This feature is only available to sites on the Premium and Professional plans, and the actual payment processing is handled by PayPal. Data Used: Transaction amount, transaction currency code, product title, product price, product ID, order quantity, PayPal payer ID, and PayPal transaction ID. Activity Tracked: The PayPal payer ID, transaction ID, and HTTP referrer are sent with a payment completion tracking event that is attached to the site owner. Data Synced (?): PayPal transaction ID, PayPal transaction status, PayPal product ID, quantity, price, customer email address, currency, and payment button CTA text. Because payments are processed by PayPal, we recommend reviewing its privacy policy. Video Hosting This feature is only available to sites on the Premium and Professional plans.

For checkout rates: destination address, purchased product IDs, dimensions, weight, and quantities. For shipping labels: customer\u2019s name, address as well as the dimensions, weight, and quantities of purchased products. Data Synced (?): For payments, we send the purchase total, currency and customer\u2019s billing information to the respective payment processor. Please see the respective third party\u2019s privacy policy (Stripe\u2019s Privacy Policy and PayPal\u2019s Privacy Policy) for more details. For automated taxes we send the value of goods in the cart, the value of shipping, and the destination address to TaxJar. Please see TaxJar\u2019s Privacy Policy for details about how they handle this information. For checkout rates we send the destination ZIP/postal code and purchased product dimensions, weight and quantities to USPS or Canada Post, depending on the service used. For shipping labels we send the customer\u2019s name, address as well as the dimensions, weight, and quantities of purchased products to EasyPost. We also store the purchased shipping labels on our server to make it easy to reprint them and handle support requests. WordPress.com Stats Data Used: IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Important: The site owner does not have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs \u2014 containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) \u2014 are retained by Automattic for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature. Activity Tracked: Post and page views, video plays (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature to honor DNT settings of visitors. By default, DNT is currently not honored. WordPress.com Toolbar This feature is only accessible to registered users of the site who are also logged in to WordPress.com. Data Used: Gravatar image URL of the logged-in user in order to display it in the toolbar and the WordPress.com user ID of the logged-in user. Additionally, for activity tracking (detailed below): IP address, WordPress.com user ID, WordPress.com username, WordPress.com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Activity Tracked: Click actions within the toolbar. ### Share this: ### PrintEmailXMoreGETTRTwitterFacebookTelegram ### Like this: ### Like Loading...

WE ARE NOT LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR, AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES RELATING TO, ANY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE OR ANY CLAIM OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE. You acknowledge that this Agreement and your use of the Mobile App is between you and us only, and not with any App Store Provider or its affiliates or subsidiaries. As between us and an App Store Provider, we are solely responsible for the Mobile App and its Content. If anything in this Agreement conflicts with any usage rules for the Mobile App from an App Store Provider, such terms from the App Store Provider control (only so far as those terms conflict with this Agreement, and then exclusively for your use of the Mobile App). All rights you have to use the Mobile App are for use only on appropriate products (which may require branding from the App Store Provider or other entities) and are non-transferable, except that the Mobile App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via features like Apple\u2019s Family Sharing (or similar features from other App Store Providers) or volume purchasing.

WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES RELATED TO ANY MOBILE APP. However, in the event that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable warranty that we cannot disclaim according to applicable law, you may have the right to notify the App Store Provider, and the App Store Provider may refund the purchase price for the Mobile App. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO APP STORE PROVIDER WILL HAVE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE MOBILE APP, AND ANY OTHER CLAIMS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, COSTS, OR EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY FAILURE TO CONFORM TO ANY WARRANTY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. We, not the App Store Provider, are responsible for addressing any claims relating to the Mobile App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation; and (iv) claims that the Mobile App infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights as well as the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. By using the Mobile App, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You acknowledge and agree that the App Store Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your use of the Mobile App, the App Store Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

Any notification that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon BREITBART actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to BREITBART a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. Repeat DMCA infringers as determined solely by us may have access to Site terminated or suspended. Notice of claims of copyright infringement can be made as follows: Designated Agent: Webmaster Address of Agent: 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049 Email for notice: copyright@breitbart.com Phone number: (805) \u2013 285-3275 If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner\u2019s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the contact address for BREITBART set forth below: your physical or electronic signature; identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content; and your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Los Angeles, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. Counter-notice of claims of copyright infringement can be sent to: Designated Agent: Webmaster Address of Agent: 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049 Email for notice: copyright@breitbart.com If a counter-notice is received, you agree that BREITBART may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at BREITBART\u2019s sole discretion.

GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; DISPUTE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF, HOWEVER, EITHER THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR COORDINATED CLAIMS PROVISION BELOW ARE FOUND INVALID, THEN THE SPECIFIC INVALID PROVISION WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND WILL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE. ## Agreement to Arbitrate ## You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy, including those known or unknown that may be later discovered, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, other agreements on the Services, or the Privacy Policy, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be either determined by binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California before one arbitrator or submitted to small claims court in Los Angeles, California. If the arbitrator finds this location to be unreasonably burdensome to you, a new location may be selected or arbitration may be conducted over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. ## No Class Actions ## YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. ## Seeking Arbitration ## If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (\u201cNotice\u201d). The Notice to us must be addressed to: Breitbart News Network, c/o Webmaster, 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from www.jamsadr.com. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000 or the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees. ## Hearing ## If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. ## Award ## In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least US $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer; we will pay your awarded damages or US $250, whichever is greater. ## Injunctive Relief ## Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Confidentiality You and we shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. Coordinated Proceedings If 25 or more individuals initiate Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are coordinated for these individuals (\u201cCoordinated Claims\u201d), the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for the individuals and our counsel for shall each select five cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (\u201cTest Cases\u201d). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against us. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to US $250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling. Governing Law and Rules This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. You and we acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement. ## Severance of Arbitration Agreement ## If the clauses concerning and describing the procedures and obligations related to Coordinated Claims and Test Case procedures is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining entire arbitration agreement and any clauses concerning, relating to, specifying or otherwise describing the arbitration agreement shall be severed from this Agreement. However, any duty of confidentiality whether or not such duty is connected with arbitration shall survive such severance.

INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING ### The Globe may deliver tailored advertising on and off our Services based on your activity across different sites on the Internet and apps known as interest-based advertising (also referred to as personalized or online behavioural advertising). To learn more on how to opt out of interest-based advertising see \u201cOpting-Out of Interest-Based Advertising\u201d. The Globe and third-party advertising companies, such as ad networks, may use cookies, pixels, SDKs, and other technologies to collect information about your activity on our sites or apps and on third-party sites and apps (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content, and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on our sites and apps, third-party sites, and across your devices. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. OPTING-OUT OF INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING As part of The Globe\u2019s commitment to fair information practice, The Globe is a participant of the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada's (DAAC) AdChoices program and adheres to its principles. The DAAC\u2019s AdChoices initiative allows you to opt-out of the use of information for interest-based advertising. For more information on this program, see https://youradchoices.ca/. Web and Mobile Browser: At any time, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on your desktop or mobile browser by clicking on the \u201cAdChoices\u201d logo on the top right corner of our site. An \u201cInterest Based Advertising\u201d screen will appear, providing you with a link to the DAAC tool that generates a list of third-party advertising companies participating in the DAAC\u2019s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Interest-Based Advertising and who are currently collecting data from your browser for the purposes of targeted advertising. You can also access the tool here. You may also see the AdChoices icon in or around advertisements on a website of The Globe. These advertisements are tailored for you through interest-based advertising. You can opt out of targeted advertising from that advertiser by clicking the \"AdChoices\" logo within the ad. Mobile App: You can opt out of any interest-based advertising on your mobile app through your mobile device settings, which vary by device. More information on how to do this can be found here: https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices. DAAC also provides a tool called AppChoices to help you opt-out that can be downloaded here: https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools/. IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT YOUR OPT-OUTS If you opt-out of interest-based advertising by us or a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes, including analytics, and you will still see ads from us across the Internet, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests. On web browsers, interest-based advertising opt-outs work by saving cookies in your browser that tells the various ad partners that you have opted-out. For mobile devices, interest-based advertising opt-outs work by sending an opt-out signal that tells the various ad partners that you have opted-out on a particular device. You must opt out separately on each of your browsers and mobile devices from which you do not want to receive interest-based advertising to ensure that information collected on a particular browser or device is not used on another browser or device. If you delete or clear your browser\u2019s cookies, you will need to opt-out again. For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop, mobile browser, or apps, please visit the DAAC website: youradchoices.ca. OTHER OPTIONS We use Google Ad Manager to serve our ads. Another option to opt-out of personalized ads served by The Globe using Google is to use Google\u2019s own opt-out: https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?ref=mac-hub&hl=en. To learn about your choices with Google: https://safety.google/privacy/ads-and-data/. ### 6.

Prerequisites for registering a User Account and registration process User must be of age and have full legal capacity. User must provide accurate and complete details upon registration and must keep them up to date. User must provide a valid email address. User warrants that they are entitled to receive email at such email address. Springer Nature is not obliged to use such email address for communication with User. User may review the data entered and correct any errors or terminate the registration process at any time before sending off the completed registration form. By clicking the confirmation button, User registers a User Account. Springer Nature will send User a confirmation of receipt of their registration. Springer Nature may reject registrations for any or no reason. The contract on using the user account will not be filed and will not be accessible to User. Individual User Account and Institutional User Account If User wants to order Products as an Individual Customer as well as on behalf of an Institutional Customer (section A.1.6), User must register two separate User Accounts for those different purposes, i.e. one User Account for placing orders as an Individual Customer (\u201cIndividual User Account\u201d) and another User Account for placing orders on behalf of the relevant Institutional Customer (\u201cInstitutional User Account\u201d). User may, however, always register only one Individual User Account and only one Institutional User Account. User must use a private email address for their Individual User Account and their professional email address (provided by the relevant Institutional Customer) for their Institutional User Account. Upon registering an Institutional Account, User warrants and represents that they are duly authorized by the relevant Institutional Customer to act as its agent and conclude contracts in the name of that Institutional Customer. Using the User Account User\u2019s role when using their User Account(s) When using their Individual User Account, User shall always be deemed to act in their own name; when using their Institutional User Account, User shall always be deemed to act on behalf of the relevant Institutional Customer. This means: If User orders Products as an Individual Customer, User shall be the Customer (as defined in clause A.1.6) and the Authorized User (as defined in A.1.7). If User orders Products on behalf of the relevant Institutional Customer, that Institutional Customer shall be the Customer (as defined in clause A.1.6), but User shall be the (only) Authorized User (as defined in clause A.1.7). Strictly personal use A User Account is always User\u2019s personal account. It provides User with access to the Digital Content and/or Services which they are authorized to use as the Authorized User (section A.4.1) according to the User\u2019s rights of use for Digital Content (section B.2.7) and/or the specific terms for the relevant Service. This means: User may not let other persons (including other persons affiliated with the same Institutional Customer) use their User Account and/or any Digital Content and/or Services which can be accessed from their User Account. User may not give other persons access to downloaded Digital Content or share downloaded Digital Content with other persons in any form. User may not give other persons access to any results created using a Service or share such results unless expressly authorized to do so under the applicable terms of the relevant Service (clause A.1.1). User\u2019s obligations and consequences of noncompliance User must keep their user credentials confidential. If User has reason to suspect that another person may have access to, or be using, their User Account, User must inform Springer Nature immediately and set a new password. Where User is responsible for third-party use of their User Account due to noncompliance with said obligations, User shall be liable for all consequences, including payment for orders. Springer Nature may suspend or terminate a User Account after a warning or immediately in order to prevent misuse. In such event, User may not re-register without Springer Nature\u2019s prior written consent. The suspension or termination of the User Account shall not affect Springer Nature\u2019s right to continue to use User content already submitted by User. Ordering products User may put any Product in the shopping cart by clicking the relevant button on the Product page. User can review the content of the shopping cart at any time and may alter the number of copies (for goods only) or remove Products from the shopping cart or terminate the order process before submitting their order. By clicking the confirmation button, User submits their order. Springer Nature will send User a confirmation of receipt; subject to clause A.5.3 the contract is concluded upon such confirmation. The contract will not be filed and will not be accessible to User, but Springer Nature will include the Terms and Conditions in the confirmation email. Should the payment process not be completed successfully, i.e. Springer Nature does not receive a confirmation of Customer\u2019s payment from the relevant payment service provider, Springer Nature will not confirm the order, but notify Customer of the failure of payment, and no contract will be deemed made.

Any provisions on the term of the User Account and on Rentals, Subscriptions and Services shall not affect the right of either party to terminate a contract for cause with immediate effect. Notice of termination by Customer Any notice of termination must be in in writing. For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies: \u201cIn writing\u201d means \u201ctext form\u201d (as defined in section 126b of The German Civil Code), i.e. on a \u201cdurable medium\u201d (including fax and email) and specifying the sender (see clause A.1.3 for Springer Nature\u2019s contact details). Springer Nature\u2019s Liability For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies: For Goods and Digital Products there is a legal guarantee of conformity. Claims arising from that guarantee become statute-barred within two years after the goods have been received or the Digital Product was provided, in the case of the continuous provision of a Digital Product not earlier than 12 months after the end of the provision of the Digital Product. Springer Nature\u2019s liability shall not be limited in any event for any loss or damage which is (a) due to intent or gross negligence; (b) for loss of life, limb, or health. Strict liability under the German Product Liability Act shall not be limited. If an essential contractual obligation (i.e. an obligation the performance of which is necessary for due implementation of the contract, the performance of which a contractual partner generally may rely on, and the breach of which jeopardizes the attainment of the purpose of the contract) was breached due to slight negligence, Springer Nature\u2019s liability shall be limited to that loss or damage the occurrence of which is typical with regard to the nature of the contract and was foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract. In all other cases, Springer Nature shall not be liable, for whatever cause in law. For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies: Springer Nature warrants that it has the right to grant Customer the rights granted in these Terms and Conditions. Except for foregoing express warranty and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Springer Nature provides all Goods, Digital Content and Subscriptions (the \u201cContent\u201d) \u201cas is\u201d and makes no other representation or warranty. Springer Nature expressly disclaims any liability for any claim arising from or out of the Content, including but not limited to any errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or defects contained therein, and any implied or express warranty as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Springer Nature\u2019s liability for any and all claims under this agreement is limited to the agreed amounts actually paid by the customer at the time of the relevant purchase. Customer is obliged to make regular complete backups of data produced or stored by Customer at reasonable intervals that reflect the value of such data. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any loss of such data which could have been avoided by Customer\u2019s compliance with said obligation. Application of the Terms and Conditions, amendments The contract on the use of the User Account and all contracts concluded in the Online Shop shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions as well as any other terms and conditions or other legal terms applicable to websites on which Customer has created the User Account. Should Customer have its own terms of business, such terms shall only apply where Springer Nature has expressly agreed to them in writing prior to conclusion of the relevant contract. Springer Nature may amend these Terms and Conditions if Springer Nature deems the amendment necessary to adapt these Terms and Conditions to changes in statutory law or case-law or to technical developments, or due to the introduction of new products or features of products. Springer Nature will notify the User/Customer of its intent to amend the Terms and Conditions and the envisaged date of the amended Terms and Conditions entering into force. If User/Customer does not object to the amendment within one month after receipt of said notification (the \u201cObjection Period\u201d), User/Customer shall be deemed to have agreed to the amended Terms and Conditions. In said notification, Springer Nature shall point out the legal relevance of the Objection Period. Should User/Customer object to the amendment, Springer Nature may give notice of termination of the relevant contract(s) at the time when the amended Terms and Conditions come into force; in such event Springer Nature shall without undue delay reimburse on a pro rata basis any advance payments of subscription fees. Severability Should any provision of these Terms and Conditions be or become ineffective or unenforceable, this shall not affect the remainder of these Terms and Conditions. In any such case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a clause which is to substitute the ineffective/unenforceable provision, reasonably balancing the parties\u2019 interests. Governing law and venue For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies: Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with German law, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). If User/Customer is a natural person who concluded a contract for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside their trade or profession, this shall not have the result of depriving the User/Customer of the protection afforded to them by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law of the country where the User/Consumer has their habitual residence. The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Heidelberg, Germany for all legal disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship between Springer Nature and the User/Customer in the following circumstances: User/Customer is a registered trader according to the German Commercial Code, a public corporation or a special trust managing public assets; User\u2019s/Customer\u2019s place of residence or habitual place of abode is outside Germany or User/Customer relocated their place of residence or habitual place of abode outside Germany after the conclusion of the contract; User\u2019s/Customer\u2019s place of residence or habitual place of abode is not known at the time when legal action is filed. For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies: Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in New York, NY, USA. Out-of-court settlements/jury trial We do not engage in out-of-court settlements before consumer arbitration bodies. However, we are obliged to inform you that the European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution, which is available at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/. For Customers having their habitual residence in North America, Central America or South America, the following applies: User/Customer expressly waives the right to a trial by jury. ### Special provisions for specific products ### Purchase of Goods Springer Nature shall deliver Goods within the time specified at the time the order is placed. Springer Nature shall deliver Goods using an appropriate shipping method chosen in its reasonable discretion; shipping costs shall never exceed the amount specified specified at the time the order is placed. Springer Nature may make partial deliveries where Customer can be reasonably expected to accept partial delivery; this will never result in higher shipping costs to be borne by Customer. Access to Digital Content General prerequisites For using digital content, e.g. reading purchased or rented eBooks, and for reading content downloaded from Personal Collections, Customer/Authorized User needs normal Internet access and software for viewing documents in the electronic format specified on the Product page, if any. Authorized User needs to log into their User Account in order to trigger the download of Digital Content. Digital Content purchased for Download can be downloaded by Authorized User immediately after the conclusion of the contract. Coupon codes Springer Nature in some cases offers coupon codes to purchase Digital Content for download in the Online Shop. \u201cE-Book inside\u201d means an eBook accessible via a coupon code imprinted in a print book. The Customer may order the corresponding eBook for free. \u201cCompanion eBook\u201d means an eBook offered to the buyer of the corresponding print book. The Customer may order the corresponding eBook a reduced price. Rentals Authorized User needs to log into their User Account in order to view the Digital Content. Rentals give Authorized User the right to view the rented Digital Content for a fixed term, as specified on the Product page. Authorized User may make copies of the Digital Content only to the extent allowed by the exceptions and limitations under applicable copyright law. Personal Collections Only Individual Customers may order access to a Personal Collection; if User orders a Personal Collection using an Institutional User Account (section A.3.3.1), neither User nor any other person shall be deemed an Authorized User. Authorized User will be granted access to the relevant Personal Collection(s) on a Digital Content Platform immediately after the conclusion of the contract (\u201cactivation\u201d). Authorized User may use the Digital Content Platform to the extent necessary to access their activated Personal Collection(s), either (a) via direct log-in to the Digital Content Platform (using the same credentials as for the Online Shop) or (b) via a link on the Product page of the relevant Personal Collection. Springer Nature may, in its discretion, add new content to a Personal Collection or replace existing content with revised editions, but Springer Nature shall not be obliged to make such updates. Removal of Digital Content Springer Nature reserves the right to discontinue the distribution of specific eBooks etc. or to remove parts of Personal Collections in the event of copyright infringements or any other legal issue which could give rise to Springer Nature\u2019s liability towards third parties. Should Authorized User have not downloaded removed content within 12 months after conclusion of the contract, Springer Nature will reimburse to Customer the purchase price in full or in part (if the removed content was part of a Personal Collection). Rights of Use for Digital Content Authorized User may use Digital Content only for personal purposes and subject to the restrictions set out in this section B.2 or to the extent allowed by the exceptions and limitations under applicable copyright law. Springer Nature reserves the right to mark purchased items of Digital Content with User\u2019s name and email address, using an electronic watermark or other technical identification marks, including means that are not evident to User; or to equip them with technological measures designed to prevent infringements of intellectual property rights (\u201cTechnological Measures\u201d). Authorized User may use and store Downloaded Digital Content (including parts thereof) only on end devices used by the Authorized User personally. The following in particular is not permitted: making unauthorized additional copies, in particular on end devices or media to which third parties have access; adapting digital content; distributing Digital Content to third parties or making it available to the public (including on intranets); circumventing Technological Measures. Springer Nature reserves the right to block Authorized User\u2019s access to Digital Content if Authorized User is in breach of clauses B.2.7.1 or B.2.7.3 and/or may give notice of termination for cause with immediate effect. The same applies if an Institutional Customer is found to have ordered a Personal Collection in breach of clause B.2.4.1. Clauses B.2.7.1 to B.2.7.4 apply to Personal Collections accordingly. Authorized User\u2019s right to use Digital Content which is the subject matter of a Rental or was downloaded from a Personal Collection or under a subscription granting access to Digital Content (point (b) of clause A.1.4.4) shall expire as soon as the respective rental term or subscription term expires. After that Authorized User may no longer use the relevant Digital Content and must delete any copies; Springer Nature may block access to such Digital Content. Apress Access: By way of exception to clause B.2.6.6 the following applies: Upon termination of the Apress Access subscription, Authorized User may continue to use any Apress eBooks that they downloaded during the term of the subscription. Subscriptions Subscriptions of journals and magazines (including eJournals and eMagazines) are always made for one calendar year as the initial term. Monthly Subscriptions will run for an indefinite time after expiry of the initial term, if any, and one month\u2019s notice of termination may be given any time.

Rolling 30-day subscription will run for an indefinite time on a 30-day subscription cycle, termination may be given at any time and will be effective at the end of the subscription cycle in which the notice of termination has been given. ## Guided Open Access Terms and Conditions ## Date of version: 6th January 2021 By submitting your manuscript (your \u201cArticle\u201d) for consideration under Nature Portfolio\u2019s Guided Open Access programme, you indicate that you have read and accept these terms and conditions (\u201cthe Terms\u201d). If you do not accept all applicable Terms, please do not submit your Article for consideration by the Guided Open Access programme. Please note that we may change these Terms from time to time without notice so you should review them each time that you plan to submit a manuscript for consideration through Guided Open Access. In addition to these Terms, Nature Portfolio websites and platforms (\u201cSites\u201d) that you visit in connection with Guided Open Access have terms and conditions which apply to the Site(s) on which they appear or the services available on the Sites (\"Additional Terms\"). Please ensure that you read any Additional Terms and the Privacy Policy as they form part of these Terms in respect of the Site(s) to which they relate. To the extent that the Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, these Terms shall prevail. We draw your attention to the limitations on liability contained in clause 6 below and to the consents to data transfer and processing contained in clause 5 below. ### Index ### Guided Open Access Eligibility Charges Right of Withdrawal Your personal information Our liability Severance Variation Applicable law and jurisdiction ### 1. Guided Open Access ### Guided Open Access (\u201cGuided OA\u201d) is a programme that enables you to submit your Article to one Nature Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated journals in the Nature Portfolio. See our Guided OA page for further details on the Guided OA programme. a.Initial Submission In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when submitting your Article to a participating Nature Research Journal, and provide all information required pursuant to the submission process. If your Article is deemed appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial Assessment Charge (see Charges, below). If your Article is determined not to be suitable for any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial Assessment Charge will be payable. b.Editorial Assessment Report Once your article has been assigned to a handling editor and you have provided billing details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in accordance with our standard practices. On the basis of their expert judgement, and the feedback from one round of peer review, the Nature Portfolio editor responsible for your Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR). The EAR will typically provide an editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers\u2019 feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary. If your Article is provisionally recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article. If you choose to continue with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the journal\u2019s standard practice. However, you are under no obligation to continue with a recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of your Article to another journal. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN GUIDED OA (1) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ARTICLE WILL BE PEER REVIEWED AT THE JOURNAL OF YOUR CHOICE, AND (2) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR ARTICLE IN ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING JOURNAL, OR IN ANY OF THE PARTICIPATING JOURNALS. SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHING DECISIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGH STANDARDS OF NATURE PORTFOLIO JOURNALS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANUSCRIPT FOR PUBLICATION IN PARTICIPATING JOURNALS UNDER THE GUIDED OA PROGRAMME WILL BE NO GREATER THAN FOR MANUSCRIPTS SUBMITTED TO SUCH JOURNALS UNDER STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION OR OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING TERMS. c. Publication Articles published through the Guided OA Programme will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. ### 2. Eligibility ### If you are affiliated with an institution participating in a Fully OA agreement or Transformative (or Compact) agreement that includes Nature Portfolio journals, you will not be eligible for Guided Open Access, where fees are applied before acceptance (Editorial Assessment Charge). Direct Open Access is available to you by selecting the open access option once your paper has been accepted, with your fees covered by the relevant institutional agreement. Please check our OA agreement pages for further information about what fees are covered. ### 3. Charges ### Once your Article has entered the Guided Open Access process, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Editorial Assessment Charge (EAC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the EAC. THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT CHARGE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN IF YOUR ARTICLE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF THE GUIDED OA JOURNALS PURSUANT TO THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT OR IS OTHERWISE NOT PUBLISHED IN A GUIDED OA JOURNAL FOR ANY REASON. If your article is accepted for publication after completion of the peer review process at a recommended journal, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Top-Up Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the Top-Up APC. If your Article is published in a Nature Research journal (Nature Physics, Nature Methods or Nature Genetics), the combined amount of the EAC and the Top-Up APC will be lower than the cost of publishing on an open access basis directly through those journals, outside of Guided OA. IF YOUR ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS OR ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS JOURNALS, THE COMBINED AMOUNT OF THE EAC AND THE TOP-UP APC WILL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PUBLISHING ON AN OPEN ACCESS BASIS DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF SUCH JOURNALS, OUTSIDE OF GUIDED OA. Please see the Nature Research Guided Open Access page for exact costs. ### 4. Right of Withdrawal ### You have the right to withdraw from your agreement to pay the EAC or Top-Up APC within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (for customers domiciled or established in North, Central or South America: Springer Nature Customer Service Center LLC, 200 Hudson Street, Suite 503, Jersey City, NJ 07311, USA, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: ORSupport@springernature.com; for customers domiciled or established in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Australia: Springer Nature Customer Service Center GmbH, Tiergartenstr. 15-17, 69121 Heidelberg, Germany, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: ORSupport@springernature.com) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail).

We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook\u2019s logos (white \u201cf\u201d on blue tile or a \u201cthumps-up\u201d-sign) or by the additional text \u201cFacebook Social Plugin\u201d. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: http://developers.facebook.com/plugins. If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user\u2019s browser directly connects to Facebook\u2019s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook\u2019s servers and included in the website by the user\u2019s browser. Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user\u2019s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin \u2013 for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something \u2013 the user\u2019s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user\u2019s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany. The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user\u2019s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php. If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage. The user may also block Facebook\u2019s plugins using add-ons for the user\u2019s browser, for example the \u201cFacebook Blocker\u201c. b) Twitter We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (\u201cTwitter\u201d) The buttons are marked using the text \u201cTwitter\u201d or \u201cFollow\u201d and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share an article or a website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter. If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user\u2019s browser directly connects to Twitter\u2019s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter\u2019s servers and included in the website by the user\u2019s browser. According to the provider\u2019s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website\u2019s URL when the button is loaded from Twitter\u2019s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the Twitter-button. Further information can be found in Twitter\u2019s privacy statement under: https://twitter.com/privacy.

Research Square We work closely with Research Square (of which Springer Nature is an investor) to provide Springer Nature authors with optional services to improve their manuscript and provide greater transparency into the peer review process. Research Square (Research Square R&D LLC, 601 W. Main St. Suite 102, Durham, NC, USA) provides software and services to the research community to help them communicate, publish and promote their research. Where enabled on the journal Springer Nature authors are provided with access to a private author dashboard upon submission to the journal which provides granular insight into the status of their manuscript as it progresses through the peer-review process, and a place where authors can improve their manuscript via free and paid for services offered by Research Square, should they wish. Where offered during submission, authors will be able to opt in to the In Review service which posts their manuscript as a permanent, public, preprint on the Research Square platform. The preprint will be published under a CC-BY license. To be able to offer both services, Springer Nature will send Research Square R&D LLC data on the author\u2019s manuscript and status updates as it progresses through the peer-review process. The data transferred includes: manuscript metadata (title, authors (names, email addresses, corresponding author details) subject areas, keywords, funding information); manuscript, figure, table and supplementary information files (but not cover letters and any other files explicitly indicated to be for use of editorial staff only) of initial submissions only for hybrid and subscription titles, and all versions for Open Access titles; notification and date of key stages in the peer-review process. These stages include but are not limited to: passing of initial checks, manuscript assignment to an editor, peer reviewers invited, peer reviewers agreed, peer review reports returned, editorial decision. For journals that operate an open or transparent peer review model for all submitted manuscripts, the reviewer reports (but not reviewer identities) are also passed to Research Square. For these titles only the reviewer reports are posted in the private author dashboard and never publicly. Research Square uses this data to populate the peer review timeline in the private author dashboard, and surface free and paid for services that are appropriate to the author depending on where their manuscript is within the peer-review process.
